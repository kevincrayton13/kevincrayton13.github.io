							<h4>Instructions</h4>
							<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The program will find the shortest path from the green dot to
								 the red dot. The user may move these dots by clicking and dragging them to the desired location.
							 	The user may also choose to introduce obstacles to challenge the algorithm a little. This is done by
								right clicking and hovering over desired locations. This enables the user to draw a line with one
								click instead of clicking for each node they wish to block. Once the user is satisfied with their work,
								the enter key will run the algorithm and find the shortest path between the two points. Press R to do
								the whole process over again.</p>

							<h4>Additional Information</h4>
							<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The A-Star algorithm is an offshoot of the Dijkstra algorithm
								that aimed to shave off some time finding the endpoint. Dijkstra only takes the cost of the path into
								consideration, meaning that if your target is on a costly path, Dijkstra will find that point last.
								A-Star addresses this by factoring in the distance to the target from the point being evaluated.
								This will ensure that progress is being made toward the target endpoint, even if that path is costly.
