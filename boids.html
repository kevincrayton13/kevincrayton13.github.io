							<h4>Instructions</h4>
							<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The program models a flock of birds, and how they will
								slowly regather themselves after being disturbed. The user may add a 'boid' by left clicking
								anywhere in the chart, and create a disturbance (so the 'boids' separate) by right clicking
								a location.</p>
							<a href='boids.exe'>Executable File (The program will need a second to load everything, no need to type anything)</a>

							<h4>Additional Information</h4>
							<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boids is an artificial life program developed by Craig Reynolds. It has three simple rules. 1: The Boids
								(Birds with a New York accent) must be separated by a certain amount. 2: The Boids must seek to align
								with each other. 3: The Boids must go towards the average position of their flockmates. The additional rule
								included in the program is they must avoid the position that is right clicked, simulating a predator
								or some other threat.</p>
