							<h4>Additional Information</h4>
							<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any user with a remedial knowledge of cyphers would immediately balk at the pictures of Caesar
								at the top of the page and say 'A Caesar cypher is perfectly breakable!', and they would be right.
								But when chained together, and the keys chosen are truly random and only used once, an unbreakable cypher is formed and is known as the
								One Time Pad (OTP). Here is a simplified example: Say a user wishes to send the message 'cat'. The first step
								would be to pick at random the key they wish to use. This key must be the same length as the message. In this example,
								the key will be bcd (this is not a very secure key, but it was chosen to make the example more understandable).
								To encrypt the first character of the message 'c', it is transposed to 'd'(one letter away), since the first character in the
								key 'b' is one letter away from 'a'. The second character of the message is 'a', so that character is changed to 'c' (two letters away)
								because the second character in the key 'c' is two letters away from 'a'. The final character in the message is 't',
								which will be changed to 'w' (three letters away) because the third character in the key is d, which is three letters away from a.
								A challenge when using this cypher in real life is ensuring that the key and message get to the recipient safely.
								Common practice was to write a bunch of keys beforehand, and give a copy to each sender/recipient. Once that key was used,
								both the sender and the recipient would tear the key off of the top of the collection of keys and destroy it, ensuring
								that the key was not used again as well as making sure both the sender and recipient were using the same key at
								the same time.<p>
